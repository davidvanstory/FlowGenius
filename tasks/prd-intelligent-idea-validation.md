# Product Requirements Document: Intelligent Idea Validation Enhancement

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enhances the existing process user turn node in the FlowGenius LangGraph workflow to intelligently validate and refine user ideas through natural conversation. After a user provides voice input, the system will transparently analyze the transcription against a comprehensive idea validation checklist and ask strategic probing questions to help users develop fully fleshed-out product concepts.

The goal is to transform casual brainstorming into structured idea development through intelligent AI-guided conversation, ensuring users think through all critical aspects of their product ideas.

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Idea Development**: Ensure all critical aspects of a product idea are thoroughly explored and documented
2. **Natural User Experience**: Provide intelligent guidance through conversational interface without exposing underlying checklist mechanics
3. **Context-Aware Questioning**: Ask relevant, adaptive questions based on user responses and conversation history
4. **Progressive Validation**: Systematically validate ideas through incremental questioning over multiple voice interactions
5. **User Engagement**: Maintain natural conversation flow while collecting structured information

## User Stories

1. **As a product brainstormer**, I want to discuss my ideas naturally through voice input so that I can explore concepts without formal structure
2. **As a product brainstormer**, I want the AI to ask thoughtful follow-up questions so that I can develop more comprehensive ideas
3. **As a product brainstormer**, I want to see my progress through the ideation process so that I understand how complete my idea is
4. **As a product brainstormer**, I want the AI to remember our previous conversations so that we can build on past discussions
5. **As a product brainstormer**, I want to know when my idea is fully developed so that I can move to the next phase

## Functional Requirements

### Core Validation Logic
1. The system must maintain a universal idea validation checklist with the following criteria:
   - Problem definition and scope
   - Target user identification
   - User pain points analysis
   - Solution approach and problem-solving method
   - Key features list with descriptions
   - User interaction flow outline
   - Key UI aspects description
   - Style, design, and visual details
   - Competition analysis and differentiation
   - Technical implementation details (tech stack, frontend, backend, data storage, security)

2. The system must analyze each voice transcription against the checklist to identify missing or incomplete information

3. The system must generate intelligent, contextual probing questions based on:
   - Current checklist gaps
   - User's previous responses
   - Conversation context from last 10-20 transcriptions
   - Type and nature of the idea being discussed

### Question Management
4. The system must ask maximum 2-3 probing questions per voice interaction to avoid overwhelming the user

5. The system must adapt questioning style based on the specific idea and user responses

6. The system must handle partial answers by probing once more, then moving to next criteria if user doesn't provide complete response on second attempt

7. The system must display probing questions in the chat interface as natural conversation

### Context & Memory
8. The system must maintain conversation context for the last 10-20 voice transcriptions

9. The system must remember which checklist items have been addressed and their completion status

10. The system must track conversation history to avoid repetitive questioning

### User Interface
11. The system must display a progress indicator (loading bar) showing validation progress through the checklist

12. The system must operate transparently without exposing the underlying checklist to the user

13. The system must integrate seamlessly with existing chat interface

### Completion Handling
14. The system must recognize when all checklist criteria are satisfactorily addressed

15. The system must notify the user that their idea sounds comprehensive upon completion

16. The system must offer next steps or actions after idea validation is complete

### Integration Requirements
17. The system must trigger idea validation analysis for every voice input through the process user turn node

18. The system must maintain existing LangGraph workflow functionality while adding validation layer

19. The system must preserve all existing audio recording and transcription capabilities

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-session persistence**: Initial version will not persist validation state across app restarts
2. **Multiple idea tracking**: Will not handle multiple concurrent idea validation sessions
3. **Idea export/sharing**: Will not include functionality to export or share validated ideas
4. **Custom checklist creation**: Users cannot modify or create custom validation checklists
5. **Idea comparison**: Will not compare multiple ideas or provide ranking functionality
6. **Integration with external tools**: Will not integrate with project management or documentation tools

## Design Considerations

### User Experience
- Progress indicator should be subtle and non-intrusive
- Questions should feel natural and conversational, not interrogative
- Chat interface should clearly distinguish between user messages and AI probing questions
- Loading states should indicate when AI is analyzing transcription

### Conversation Flow
- Questions should build logically on previous responses
- AI should acknowledge user responses before asking follow-up questions
- Natural conversation breaks should be respected

## Technical Considerations

### LangGraph Integration
- Enhance existing `processUserTurn.ts` node to include validation logic
- Maintain existing workflow state management
- Add new state fields for checklist tracking and conversation context

### Data Management
- Store validation checklist state in workflow state
- Implement conversation context buffer (10-20 transcriptions)
- Track completion status for each checklist criterion

### AI/LLM Integration
- Leverage existing LLM infrastructure for intelligent question generation
- Implement context-aware prompting for natural conversation flow
- Add validation logic for determining question necessity and timing

### Performance
- Ensure validation analysis doesn't significantly impact response time
- Optimize context management for large conversation histories
- Implement efficient checklist state tracking

## Success Metrics

1. **Idea Completeness**: 90% of ideas that complete the validation process address all checklist criteria
2. **User Engagement**: Users continue conversation for average of 15+ voice interactions during idea development
3. **Question Relevance**: Less than 10% of probing questions are deemed irrelevant by users
4. **Completion Rate**: 70% of users who start idea validation complete the full process
5. **Response Quality**: Average response length increases by 40% as users provide more detailed answers
6. **User Satisfaction**: 85% of users rate the idea development process as helpful

## Open Questions

1. Should the system provide summaries of the validated idea at completion?
2. How should the system handle when users want to modify previously validated aspects?
3. Should there be different validation intensity levels for different types of products?
4. How should the system handle off-topic conversations that don't relate to idea development?
5. Should the progress indicator show specific categories or just overall completion percentage?
6. What happens if a user explicitly states they don't want to answer certain questions?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic checklist validation logic
- Simple probing question generation
- Progress indicator
- Integration with existing processUserTurn node

### Phase 2 (Enhanced)
- Advanced context-aware questioning
- Improved conversation memory management
- Completion notifications and next steps

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- Adaptive questioning based on user expertise
- Enhanced progress visualization
- Conversation quality analytics
