## Relevant Files

- `electron/main/langgraph/nodes/processUserTurn.ts` - Replace keyword-based analysis with GPT-4 API calls for intelligent validation and questioning
- `electron/main/langgraph/nodes/processUserTurn.test.ts` - Unit tests for GPT-4 enhanced processUserTurn functionality  
- `electron/main/services/openaiService.ts` - Create OpenAI service for GPT-4 API integration and API key management
- `electron/main/services/openaiService.test.ts` - Unit tests for OpenAI service
- `.env` or environment configuration - Add OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- `src/components/Chat.tsx` - Add progress indicator to existing chat interface
- `src/types/AppState.ts` - Update existing types if needed for enhanced validation state

### Notes

- The processUserTurn.ts file has keyword-based checklist functionality that needs to be replaced with actual GPT-4 API calls
- OpenAI API key must be securely managed and configured in environment variables
- All analysis and question generation should use GPT-4 instead of hardcoded logic
- Progress indicator should integrate seamlessly with existing chat UI
- Use existing LangGraph workflow and state management patterns

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Enhance ProcessUserTurn Node with Intelligent LLM-Powered Validation
  - [x] 1.1 Set up OpenAI GPT-4 API integration with API key management and error handling
  - [x] 1.2 Define system prompt for GPT-4 positioning it as an experienced product manager: "You are a product manager with extensive experience developing successful products. You have very clear criteria about designing and brainstorming products that you want users to share with you. Your goal is to help users think through all critical aspects of their product ideas through intelligent questioning and analysis."
  - [x] 1.3 Update checklist criteria to match PRD requirements (problem definition, target users, pain points, solution approach, key features, user interactions, UI aspects, design/visuals, competition analysis, technical implementation)
  - [x] 1.4 Implement dynamic GPT-4 generated checklist system replacing hardcoded DEFAULT_BRAINSTORM_CHECKLIST with intelligent, idea-specific criteria generation
  - [x] 1.5 Replace existing keyword-based `analyzeUserResponse()` function with GPT-4 API call to intelligently analyze which checklist items are addressed in user transcriptions
  - [x] 1.6 Replace hardcoded `generateChecklistBasedResponse()` function with GPT-4 API call for dynamic, context-aware question generation
  - [x] 1.7 Implement conversation context memory system that passes last 10-20 transcriptions to GPT-4 for context-aware analysis and questioning
  - [ ] 1.8 Add GPT-4 powered question prioritization that limits responses to 2-3 most important questions per interaction
  - [ ] 1.9 Implement GPT-4 partial answer detection with intelligent follow-up probing (probe once more, then move on if incomplete)
  - [ ] 1.10 Add GPT-4 powered completion detection and personalized congratulatory messaging when all checklist criteria are satisfied
  
- [ ] 2.0 Add Progress Indicator to Chat Interface
  - [ ] 2.1 Add progress bar component to Chat.tsx that displays validation progress percentage
  - [ ] 2.2 Connect progress indicator to checklist_state from LangGraph workflow state
  - [ ] 2.3 Style progress indicator to be subtle and non-intrusive, matching existing UI design
  - [ ] 2.4 Add loading states during LLM analysis to indicate processing
