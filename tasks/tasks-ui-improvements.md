### Notes

- Unit tests should be created/updated for all component changes to ensure functionality is maintained
- Use `npm test` or `npm run test:watch` to run tests during development
- The sidebar toggle functionality should be completely removed, not just hidden
- Recording flow should bypass permission dialog when possible and start immediately
- Text contrast should follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG AA minimum)
