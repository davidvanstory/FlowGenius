I want to improve the UI quite a bit. Right now the sidebar and the overlaps with the main conversation component and I want the sidebar to be always persistent instead of being toggleable on or off. I want to be permanent and I want the sidebar to be less busy with text and just for each new session to have the title but you can remove the brainstorm and the summary tag and the PRD tag and so all it is is just a clean list of the conversations and the new session button and then for the main conversation tab the text is currently difficult to read because it is gray text on a white background and I want it to be much more legible. And then for the recording at the moment it requires three clicks to record a message. I have to click the microphone in the text input field and then I have to a modal comes up where I have to then click continue to recording and then the third button comes up which is just a microphone again and then I click that and that starts the voice recording and I just want the voice recording to start the first time when I click the microphone the very first time and then the actual microphone recording icon blocks a large portion of the chat interface and so it actually blocks the questions that come up so I can't actually read them. So I want the microphone icon to be put off to the side and but I like the green circle that surrounds it when it's in recording mode or red circle some indicator but I just want it to not be on top of the chat interface.
