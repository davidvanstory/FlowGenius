### Notes

- **LangGraph First**: We build the LangGraph workflow engine early (task 3.0) because it's the orchestration layer that connects all features. This prevents having to retrofit isolated functions later.
- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- All components must be thoroughly commented with JSDoc and include extensive console logging.
- The codebase must be modular and extensible for easy addition of future features.
- UI styling must closely match OpenAI's ChatGPT interface based on the provided screenshots.
